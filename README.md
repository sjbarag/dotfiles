Just some config files that I use.  Directories configured for use with [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) via something like:


```bash
stow --target $HOME bash
```

Typically the `--target` arg isn't required if this repo is cloned into a *first-level subdirectory of `$HOME`*, but I've been keeping this somewhere in `~/src` lately.
